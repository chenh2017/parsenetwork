**layout_nicely** tries to choose an appropriate layout function for the supplied graph, and uses that to generate the layout. 

**layout_with_mds** uses metric multidimensional scaling for generating the coordinates. Multidimensional scaling aims to place points from a higher dimensional space in a (typically) 2 dimensional plane, so that the distance between the points are kept as much as this is possible.

**layout_with_lgl** is a compendium of applications for making the visualization of large networks and trees tractable.  LGL was specifically motivated by the need to make the visualization and exploration of large biological networks more accessible.
